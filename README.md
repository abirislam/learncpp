# learncpp

## Basic Information
- This repo stores my work while learning C++
- All of the problems and solutions can be found [here](https://learncpp.com/)
- Each of the solutions are organized by chapter, and the final chapter is the solution denoted by x
- Thus chapter 2 final chapter would be 5-x.cpp, or something similar
- If something has a q marking, like 2-8q2.cpp, it means chapter 2 lesson 8 question 2
- p marking is the same as q marking but stands for part instead of question
